		 <h4> About Netball </h4>
		 <p>Netball is a team sport comprising of 7 players on a netball court.
		 Each player has their own playing position indicated with a bib and their own designated area of play. 
		 The playing positions include the following; 
		 Goal Shooter (GS), Goal Attacker (GA), Wing Attacker (WA), Center (C), 
		 Wing Defence (WD), Goal Defence (GD) and Goal Keeper (GK). 
		 A match comprises of 4 quarters of 10 minutes each, and teams attempt to score as many points as possible by the end of the gamme to win. 
		 </p>
		 <h4> My Netball Journey </h4>
		 <p> I first started playing Netball when I joined it as a CCA when I entered secondary school.
		 I wasn't that much of a sporty person back then, but I knew I wanted to try something new. This was one of my best decisions ever.
		 Being part of a Netball team was really fun, because of the long hours spent training with my teammates.
		 I fondly remember being under the hot sun with my teammates and going for our daily 2km runs.
		 My main role in my team was the GK position, which was in the defense line. 
		 The role required me to prevent the opposing team's GA or GS from scoring points. It was a pressuring role, but I did love it.
		 Taking part in Netball competitions and carnivals were also another highlight of my secondary school life.
		 Moving on, I sadly did not continue playing it during my polytechnic days. 
		 However, I jumped at the chance to play it again casually when I eventually entered NTU. 
		 Although I did not make the school team, at least I got to compete in Inter-Hall and Inter-School games every other year. 
		 And this was good enough for me. </p>

		  <h4>About Softball</h4>
		  <p>Softball is a team sport comprising of 9 to 10 players on the field. 
		  It is very similar to Baseball, but it differs on the pitching style - Baseball uses Overhand or Sidearm pitches whereas Softball uses an Underhand pitch. 
		  There are two types of Softball Games - Fastpitch and Slowpitch. Both games are similar but vary slightly in some rules.
		  The 9 main positions in a Softball Game - Pitcher, Catcher, 1st Base, 2nd Base, 3rd Base, 
		  Shortstop, Left Fielder, Center Fielder and Right Fielder. At times, there can be a 10th position, a Rover.
		 During an inning, the batting team plays until the fielding team is able to achieve 3 OUTS. 
		 Teams aim to score as many runs as possible during the game. The team with the most runs in a game, wins the game.
		  </p>
		  
		  <h4>My Softball Journey</h4>
		  <p> I picked up Softball when I first came into NTU. I was introduced to the sport when I went for the try-outs at my hall event. 
		  With no prior experience to this sport, it took me awhile to get used to the different skillsets and playing style,
		  such as the game concept and simply getting used to catching a ball using a glove. 
		  A few years on, it is now one of my favorite sports to play. 
		  One of my favorite memories of the sport is competiting in the Inter-Hall Games with my hall and fighting through to get to the Semi-Finals.
		  Another favorite memory was doing the Softball Module with my fellow PE classmates. It was very fun. 
		  Taking it to the next level, I went to join my friend's team, NEXUS, and we got to compete on external competitions together.
		  I hope that there would be more opportunities to play the sport once the COVID-19 measures wine down.

		<h4> About Volleyball</h4>
		<p>
		Volleyball is a net-barrier team sport which comprises of 6 players on each side of the court - 3 in the front, 3 in the back.
		The players positions mainly include a Setter, a Libero, Blockers, Spikers and Wing Spikers.
		Players are not allowed to hold the ball but they use their hands, arms or any part of their body to keep the ball above the ground.
		Teams can attempt to score a point by sending the ball over to the opposing court. 
		A point is scored when their opponents are unable to return the ball back within 3 touches or if the ball touches the ground.
		Matches are played best of five sets, and each set is played to 25 points. The team which wins best out of five sets wins the game.
		
		<h4> My Volleyball Journey </h4>
		<p> I picked up Volleyball casually when I entered NTU. 
		Although I have played it before in secondary school, I never really played it seriously.
		Only after going through trainings with my hall and a Volleyball module, then I got to truly appreciate the mechanics of the game.
		Unsurprisingly, it is now one of my favorite sports to play. 
		I play it casually with my fellow NIE school mates whenever we are free. </p>
